Item 1.  Security and Issuer.

         This statement on Schedule 13D ("Schedule 13D") is being filed with
respect to the common stock, $0.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), of 110 Media
Group, Inc. (f/k/a Dominix, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). The
Company's principal executive office is located at 95 Broadhollow Road,
Melville, New York 11747.

Item 2.  Identity and Background.

           (a) This statement is filed by Snapper Partners, LLC (the "Reporting
Person") with respect to shares directly owned by it.

           Any disclosures herein with respect to persons other than the
Reporting Person is made on information and belief after making inquiry to the
appropriate party.

           (b) The business address of Snapper Partners, LLC is 545 Madison
Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10022.

           (c) No officer, director or shareholder of the Reporting Person has
not, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding
(excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).

           (d) Neither the Reporting Person, nor, to the best of its knowledge,
any of its directors, executive officers, general partners or members has,
during the last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding
was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future
violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or
state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

           On June 4, 2004 the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation,
which among other things effectuated a 1 for 200 reverse split and increased the
number of authorized shares of common stock to 50,000,000. Snapper Partners
owned 545,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that converted on
the basis of 1 share of Series A for 200 shares of the Company's pre-split
common stock. The Company, prior to amending its Certificate of Incorporation,
did not have a sufficient number of shares authorized to effectuate this
conversion. As a result of the amendment, the Company authorized a sufficient
number of shares to allow Snapper Partners to convert its Series A Shares.
Accordingly, on June 4, 2004 Snapper Partners converted its 545,000 shares into
545,000 post-split shares of common stock. In addition, Snapper Partners
previously owned 4,500,000 (22,500 post-split) shares of common stock.
Accordingly, Snapper Partners now owns an aggregate of 567,500 shares of the
Company's common stock. The Preferred Shares and 4,500,000 pre-split shares of
common stock were purchased from the Company utilizing Snapper Partners personal
funds.

this Schedule 13D.

           (c) There have been no transactions involving the shares of common
stock of the Company engaged in during the 60 day period prior to and including

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect
              to Securities of the Issuer.

           There are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships
(legal or otherwise) among the Reporting Persons named in Item 2 of this
statement and between such Reporting Persons and any person with respect to any
securities of the Issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any
