ITEM 3: SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION.

On November 30, 2001, Dominix, Inc., (the "Company") and Diversified Capital
Holdings, LLC (f/k/a Azure Capital Holdings, LLC) ("Diversified") entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement whereby Diversified purchased an aggregate of (i)
$100,000 principal amount of the Company's 6% convertible debentures due
November 29, 2003 (the "Debentures"); and (ii) warrants to purchase 2,000,000
shares of the Company's common stock, $.0001 par value, (the "Warrants") which
Debentures and Warrants had certain registration rights as set forth in the
registration rights agreement dated of even date therewith (the "Registration
Rights Agreement"). Pursuant to nominee agreement with Diversified in which
Diversified agreed to act as nominee for Mr. Horowitz, Steven A. Horowitz
provided $25,000 of the $100,000. In accordance with the terms of the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to file a registration
statement (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange
Commission registering the shares issuable upon (i) the conversion of the
Debentures; and (ii) the exercise of the Warrants on or before January 30, 2002
and was to take all steps necessary for the SEC to declare such Registration
Statement effective, in no case later than March 30, 2002. The Company failed to
file the Registration Statement and acknowledged that a Registration Default had
occurred, for which it was solely responsible. In settlement of its default, the
Company entered into an agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with Diversified
dated the 26th day of April 2002, which amended the terms of the Debentures and
the Registration Rights Agreement, providing Diversified with the right, at any
time and in its sole discretion to convert the outstanding principal balance of
the Debentures into up to 1,333,333 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred
Stock, the Designation of which was authorized by the Company's Board of
Directors. Each share of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock is convertible,
at any time and in the sole discretion of the holder thereof into 100 shares of
the Company's common stock. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Enrique J.
Abreau, Chairman (Mr. Abreau was the sole member of the Company's Board of
Directors) and President of the Company resigned from every position which he
held with the Company effective May 30, 2002. Prior to his resignation, the
Company's Board of Directors appointed Andrew J. Schenker as the Company's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and James W. Zimbler as a Director and as
the Company's President, which appointments were made effective simultaneously
with Mr. Abreau's resignation. Mr. Schenker is the Chief Executive Officer of
Diversified as well as a Director, President and Chief Operating Officer of
CDKnet.com, Inc. ("CDK"), the sole member of Diversified. Mr. Zimbler is the
President of Diversified and is the Executive Vice President and Secretary of
CDK.

ITEM 4: PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.

The persons filing this Report believe that (a) the common stock of the Company
is significantly under-valued, (b) are concerned that steps taken by the Company
to date have been insufficient to positively impact share value, and (c) believe
that management must take further immediate steps to enhance shareholder value
in order to prevent a further deterioration of the underlying value of the
Company.

The persons filing this Report have discussed their concerns with the current
management of the Company, who have held discussions with other shareholders and
potential financial and strategic investors in the Company. The persons filing
this Report are also examining all of their options with respect to the
possibility of taking actions, which they believe will enhance shareholder
value. Such actions could include proposing that management pursue an
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or
liquidation. Any such actions could relate to or result in one or more of the
matters referred to in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Each of the persons filing this Report also reserves the right to purchase or
otherwise acquire additional Common Stock or to sell or otherwise dispose of
Common Stock owned by it, in each case in open market or privately negotiated
transactions or otherwise.
