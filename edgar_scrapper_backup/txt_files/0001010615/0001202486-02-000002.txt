            Shares.

      3.3   Expenses of Registration.  All registration expenses incurred in

            good standing as a foreign corporation, in each jurisdiction where
            the nature of its activities and of its properties (both owned and
            leased) makes such qualification necessary and where a failure to so
            qualify would have a material adverse effect on its business or
            properties.  The Amendment has been filed with the Florida Secretary
            of State on or before the date hereof.

      5.2   Corporate Power.  The Company has all requisite legal and corporate

            of the Shares has been taken.  This Agreement, when executed and
            delivered, shall constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
            the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
            laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and
            the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific
            performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

      5.4   Validity of Shares.  The Shares, when issued or sold and delivered
            in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Articles
            of Incorporation, as amended, as applicable, the Shares will be
            validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable, and will be free of
            any liens or encumbrances; provided, however, that the Shares may be
            subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by the Bylaws of the
            Company or under state and/or federal securities laws as set forth
            herein or as otherwise required by such laws at the time a transfer
