                                      -----

         1.1 Authorization. The Company has authorized the issuance and sale
pursuant to this Agreement of Three Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand
(3,350,000) shares of its Common Stock (the "Shares"). The Shares have the
rights, restrictions, privileges and preferences set forth in the Articles of
Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Amendment").

         1.2 Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in

2.       Sale, Purchase and Delivery of Shares.
         -------------------------------------

         2.1 Sale and Purchase of the Shares. The sale and purchase of the
Shares shall occur concurrently with the execution and delivery of the
Subscription Agreements.

         2.2 Delivery of the Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
and of the Subscription Agreements, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser,

Subscription Agreement(s).

3.       Registration Rights.
         -------------------

         3.1 Demand Registration. If the Company shall receive from Purchaser,
at any time or times beginning on first (1st) anniversary date of the execution
of this Agreement and concluding on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the execution
of this Agreement, a written request that the Company effect any registration
with respect to at least 500,000 of the Shares in an offering to be firmly
underwritten by underwriter(s) selected by the Purchaser (which underwriter(s)
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) the Company shall, as soon as
practicable, use its best efforts to file a registration statement covering the
Shares so requested to be registered and to effect such registration (including,
without limitation, filing post-effective amendments, appropriate qualifications
under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws, and appropriate
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and as would
permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all of such Shares as are
specified in such request. The registration statement filed pursuant to the
request of the Purchaser may include other securities of the Company, with
respect to which registration rights have been granted, and may include
securities of the Company being sold for the account of the Company.

         3.2 Piggyback Registration. If the Company proposes to register any of
its Common Stock either for its own account or the account of a security holder
or holders exercising their respective demand registration rights (other than
pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof), the Company shall use its
<PAGE>

best efforts to include in such registration (and any related qualification
under blue sky laws or other compliance) all the Shares specified in a written
request or requests, made by the Purchaser and received by the Company within
fifteen (15) days after the Purchaser's receipt of written notice from the
Company regarding the proposed registration, which written request may specify
the inclusion of all or a part of Purchaser's Shares.

         3.3 Expenses of Registration. All registration expenses incurred in
connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, shall be borne by the Company; provided, however,
that the Purchaser shall bear the registration expenses for any registration
proceeding begun pursuant to Section 3.1 and subsequently withdrawn by the
Purchaser. All selling expenses relating to securities registered pursuant to
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, shall be borne by the holders of such securities
pro rata on the basis of the number of shares of securities so registered on
their behalf.

authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. The Company is duly qualified and authorized to
do business, and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its activities and of its properties (both
owned and leased) makes such qualification necessary and where a failure to so
qualify would have a material adverse effect on its business or properties. The
Amendment has been filed with the Florida Secretary of State on or before the
date hereof.

         4.2 Corporate Power. The Company has all requisite legal and corporate

hereunder and thereunder, and for the authorization, issuance, sale and delivery
of the Shares has been taken. This Agreement, when executed and delivered, shall
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in

bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.
<PAGE>

         4.4 Validity of Shares. The Shares, when issued or sold and delivered
in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Articles of
Incorporation, as amended, as applicable, the Shares will be validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable, and will be free of any liens or encumbrances;
provided, however, that the Shares may be subject to restrictions on transfer
imposed by the Bylaws of the Company or under state and/or federal securities
laws as set forth herein or as otherwise required by such laws at the time a
transfer is proposed.

and delivered by the Purchaser, and, upon due execution and delivery by the
Company, this Agreement will be a valid and binding agreement of the Purchaser
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and the Company's Chief
Executive Officer, Purchaser shall initiate an investment banking referral
business (but shall not transfer the assets of that business) with the Company
with a minimum annual gross revenue equal to $2.5 Million.

6.       Voting Rights of Purchaser. For a period of twelve (12) months
         --------------------------
following the issuance of the Shares to Purchaser, Purchaser shall not vote such
Shares in favor of a liquidation of the Company or a merger or conversion of the
Company with any Affiliated Entity. For the purposes of

         WHEREAS, Rubin Investment Group, Inc.. and the Company entered into a
Common Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 21, 2002 for the purchase of
3,350,000 shares of common stock of 1-800 Attorney, Inc. at $0.384 per share;
and

         WHEREAS, Rubin Investment Group, Inc. purchased 225,000 shares of
common stock which were issued to Rubin Investment Group, Inc. on October 21,
2002; and

         WHEREAS, the Company has retracted 88,535 shares of the 225,000 shares
on October 24, 2002; now therefore

         The parties agree to amend the Common Stock Purchase Agreement to
provide as follows:

         1.  Rubin Investment Group, Inc. reaffirms its agreement to purchase
             the retracted 88,535 shares but understands and acknowledges that
             issuance of said shares is subject to the approval of the Company's
             shareholders, which approval will be subject to a vote of the
             shareholders to be held at a meeting of the shareholders which is
             currently scheduled for mid-November, 2002; and

         2.  Upon approval of the shareholders, and upon payment of the purchase
             price for said shares, the Company will issue 88,535 shares to
             Rubin Investment Group, Inc. in addition to the 3,125,000 shares
             which Rubin Investment Group, Inc. and the Company had previously
             agreed to submit for approval of the shareholders; and

         3.  All other terms, representations and provisions of the Common Stock
             Purchase Agreement will remain in full force and effect as of the
             date of this Amendment.

         The parties hereby execute this Amendment effective October 24, 2002.
