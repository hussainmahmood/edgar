Know all persons by these presents that the undersigned

attorney-in-fact to:

(1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director of
Haemonetics Corporation (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4 and 5
in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and the rules thereunder and such other forms as may be
required by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") relating to transactions by the undersigned in
securities issued by the Company ("Forms");

(2) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of
the undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to
complete the execution of any such Forms, complete and
execute an amendment or amendments thereto, and timely
file such Forms with the SEC and any other appropriate
governmental authority; and

(3) take any other action of any type whatsoever in
connection with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such
attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest
of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being understood
that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of
the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in
such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as such
attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full
power and authority to do and perform all and every act and thing
whatsoever requisite, necessary and proper to be done in the exercise
of any of the rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all
intents and purposes as the undersigned might or could do if
personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or
such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully
do or cause to be done by virtue of this power of attorney and
the rights and powers herein granted.  The undersigned acknowledges
that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such capacity
at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming any of the

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until
the undersigned is no longer required to file the Forms with respect

issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned
in a signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused his/her Power of
Attorney to be executed as of this 27th day of April, 2021.
