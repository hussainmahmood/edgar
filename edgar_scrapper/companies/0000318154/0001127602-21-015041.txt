Vested RSUs are paid in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-to-one basis.  Vested RSUs may be deferred by the director, in which case, payment will occur according to the elected deferral schedule.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These shares include 240 Dividend Equivalents (DEs) granted pursuant to the Director Program and subject to a qualifying dividend reinvestment plan. DEs are credited on the director's vested but deferred RSUs and are paid out in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-to-one basis along with a cash payment for any remaining fractional share amount.</footnote>
