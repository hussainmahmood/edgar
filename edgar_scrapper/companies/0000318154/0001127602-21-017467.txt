        <footnote id="F1">The Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) were granted pursuant to the Amgen Inc. 2009 Director Incentive Program, as amended, under the Amgen Inc. 2009 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the Director Plan) and vested immediately.  Vested RSUs are paid in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-to-one basis.  Vested RSUs may be deferred by the director, in which case, payment will occur according to the elected deferral schedule.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These shares include 1,088 Dividend Equivalents (DEs) granted pursuant to the Director Program and subject to a qualifying dividend reinvestment plan. DEs are credited on the director's vested but deferred RSUs and are paid out in shares of the Company's Common Stock on a one-to-one basis along with a cash payment for any remaining fractional share amount.</footnote>
