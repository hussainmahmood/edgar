    <footnotes>
        <footnote id="F1">These deferred compensation notional units were allocated under the Fiserv, Inc. Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;), under which director fees otherwise payable in cash may be deferred in exchange for the allocation of notional units under the Plan. This Form 4 reports the crediting of units under the Plan on March 31, 2021 in respect of $48,250 of deferred compensation. The number of notional units credited is calculated by dividing the amount of compensation that is deferred by the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of deferral, or last business day prior. On March 31, 2021, the closing price of Fiserv's common stock was $119.04 per share. Following cessation of the reporting person's service to the company, each notional unit will be settled in shares of Fiserv common stock on a one-for-one basis.</footnote>
