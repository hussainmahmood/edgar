resubstitution and authority as hereinafter described on behalf
of and in the name, place and stead of the Reporting Person to:
(1)	prepare, execute in the Reporting Person's name and on the
Reporting Person's behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including
amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or
