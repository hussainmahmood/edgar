        <footnote id="F1">Ms. Eglinton Manner was awarded 457 restricted stock units. Each restricted stock unit represents a contingent right to receive one share of Repligen Corporation's Common Stock. The restricted stock units vest on the earlier of May 13, 2022, one year from the grant date, or the date of the next annual meeting of the Company's shareholders, which has not yet been determined. The restricted stock units may be settled only by delivering shares of Repligen Corporation's Common Stock, and thus, the grant is being reported in Table 1 as allowed per SEC guidance.</footnote>

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Jon Snodgres, Kimberly Brown and Kenneth O'Brien the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and

the undersigned might or could do in person thereby ratifying and confirming all
that said attorney-in-fact and agent, or his substitute or substitutes, may
